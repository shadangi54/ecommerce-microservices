# Architecture for a Simple E-commerce Microservices Application

The application can be divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain. Below is the suggested architecture:

## Microservices Overview
- **Product Service:** Manages product catalog (CRUD operations, search, etc.).
- **Order Service:** Handles order creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Inventory Service:** Manages stock levels and availability.
- **User Service:** Handles user authentication and profile management.
- **Payment Service:** Processes payments and manages transactions.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications (email, SMS, etc.) for order updates.
- **Gateway Service:** Acts as an API gateway for routing and authentication.
- **Config Service:** Centralized configuration management for all services.

## APIs and Services to be Created

### Product Service
- `GET /api/products`: Fetch all products.
- `GET /api/products/{id}`: Fetch product by ID.
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update product details.
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Soft delete a product.
- `GET /api/products/search?name={name}`: Search products by name.
- `GET /api/products/low-stock?threshold={threshold}`: Get products with low stock.

### Order Service
- `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order.
- `GET /api/orders/{id}`: Fetch order by ID.
- `GET /api/orders/user/{userId}`: Fetch orders for a specific user.
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}`: Update order status (e.g., cancel, complete).

### Inventory Service
- `GET /api/inventory/{productId}`: Check stock for a product.
- `PUT /api/inventory/{productId}`: Update stock for a product.

### User Service
- `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login`: Authenticate a user.
- `GET /api/users/{id}`: Fetch user profile.
- `PUT /api/users/{id}`: Update user profile.

### Payment Service
- `POST /api/payments`: Process a payment.
- `GET /api/payments/{orderId}`: Fetch payment details for an order.

### Notification Service
- `POST /api/notifications`: Send a notification.
- `GET /api/notifications/user/{userId}`: Fetch notifications for a user.

### Gateway Service
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
- Handles authentication and authorization.

### Config Service
- Provides centralized configuration for all services.

## Suggested Technologies
- **Languages:** Java (Spring Boot for microservices).
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ/Kafka for inter-service communication.
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway.
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka/Consul.
- **Configuration Management:** Spring Cloud Config.
